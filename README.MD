<!-- I've made progress on the transactions.html page, incorporating the necessary updates to the navigation bar and ensuring all required content is included according to the specified labels. Additionally, I've integrated a sub-navigation in navbar.html, providing links to the main pages: the categories that Jones is managing, the transactions I'm responsible for, and the report page. The layout development is proceeding well; I've adhered to our principal design and built upon the code initiated by Jones. Lastly, I have established a connection between the transaction page and the backend, which allows the table to display the data we currently have stored in the backend. Please let me know if there are any issues with the functionality. the humburger menu shouwl be working as well I have added little javascript in the navbar so that the action of hiding and shwing to work. -->
